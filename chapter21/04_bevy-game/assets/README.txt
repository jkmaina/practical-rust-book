# Bevy Game Assets

Since we created SVG files, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Convert SVG to PNG
Use an online converter or tool like Inkscape:
- Convert player.svg to player.png
- Convert background.svg to background.png

## Option 2: Use any 64x64 PNG image
- Download a simple sprite from the internet
- Create one in any image editor
- Name it 'player.png' and put it in the assets/ folder

## Option 3: Use the built-in Bevy shapes
The game will still run, it just won't show the sprite if the PNG is missing.

Run the game with: cargo run
