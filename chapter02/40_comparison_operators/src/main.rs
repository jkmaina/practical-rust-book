// This program demonstrates the use of comparison operators in Rust.
// Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result.
// Common comparison operators include: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.
// In this example, we will compare integers and floating-point numbers.
// The output will show whether the comparisons are true or false.
// This is useful for making decisions in your code based on the values of variables.
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    
    println!("x == y: {}", x == y); // false
    println!("x != y: {}", x != y); // true
    
    let a = 5.0;
    let b = 5.0;
    
    println!("a == b: {}", a == b); // true
}
