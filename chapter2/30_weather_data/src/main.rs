// This program simulates a weather station's data collection and display.
// It includes current weather conditions, a forecast, and basic statistics.
// The program demonstrates the use of variables, arrays, and basic control flow in Rust.
// It will not panic, as it avoids out-of-bounds access.
// This is a common way to illustrate Rust's safety features regarding array access.
